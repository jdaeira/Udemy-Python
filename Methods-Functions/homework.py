Functions and Methods Homework

Complete the following questions:

Write a function that computes the volume of a sphere given its radius.

The volume of a sphere is given as
43π𝑟3

def vol(rad):

    pass

# Check

vol(2)

33.49333333333333

Write a function that checks whether a number is in a given range (inclusive of high and low)

def ran_check(num,low,high):

    pass

# Check

ran_check(5,2,7)

5 is in the range between 2 and 7

If you only wanted to return a boolean:

def ran_bool(num,low,high):

    pass

ran_bool(3,1,10)

True

Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculates the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.

Sample String : 'Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?'
Expected Output : 
No. of Upper case characters : 4
No. of Lower case Characters : 33

HINT: Two string methods that might prove useful: .isupper() and .islower()

If you feel ambitious, explore the Collections module to solve this problem!

def up_low(s):

    pass

s = 'Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?'

up_low(s)

Original String :  Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?
No. of Upper case characters :  4
No. of Lower case Characters :  33

Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.

Sample List : [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def unique_list(lst):

    pass

unique_list([1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,5])

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list.

Sample List : [1, 2, 3, -4]
Expected Output : -24

def multiply(numbers):  

    pass

multiply([1,2,3,-4])

-24

Write a Python function that checks whether a passed in string is palindrome or not.

Note: A palindrome is word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.

def palindrome(s):

    pass

palindrome('helleh')

True

Hard:

Write a Python function to check whether a string is pangram or not.

Note : Pangrams are words or sentences containing every letter of the alphabet at least once.
For example : "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

Hint: Look at the string module

import string

​

def ispangram(str1, alphabet=string.ascii_lowercase):

    pass

ispangram("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")

True

string.ascii_lowercase

'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

Great Job!
